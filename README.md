# Pokemon Cards

My 'Getting started with' App for React Js,
built with :

- React
- Vite
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss

Used [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=201) for the Pokemon Data. Which is obviously anyone would do to build a pokemon app :)

Deployed with the help of [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) as you can know by visting the app URL.

Now, You can [Checkout My App](https://govrdhnpokemon.netlify.app/).

And... nothing more to say. you may leave now, Have a nice day :)
